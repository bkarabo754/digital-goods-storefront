⚡ Features

✅ Zustand middleware for state management
✅ Global state via stores
✅ Code Splitting - Dynamic imports
✅ Persistent Cart - Auto-saves to localStorage
✅ Responsive Design - Mobile-first approach
✅ Type Safety - Full TypeScript coverage
✅ Performance Optimized - Memoization, lazy loading
✅ SEO Ready
✅ Accessibility - ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation

🎯 Key Architectural Decisions
State Management Strategy
Zustand over Context API/Redux because:

Simpler API with less boilerplate
Built-in persistence middleware
Granular subscriptions prevent re-renders
TypeScript-friendly
No Provider wrapper needed


Benefits for using Zustand:

Cleaner code (no manual sync)
Better performance (optimized updates)
Easier testing (pure functions)
Type-safe by default

Component Architecture
Each major feature is split into:

Main Component - Container logic
Sub-Components - Reusable pieces
Skeleton - Loading states
Index File - Lazy export for code splitting

🔧 Trade-offs & Assumptions
Trade-offs Made

Client-Side Only (SPA)

Pro: Simpler state management, no server complexity
Con: SEO requires proper metadata (implemented via Next.js metadata API)
Decision: Acceptable for bookstore with static content

localStorage for Persistence

Pro: Simple, no backend needed, works offline
Con: Limited to 5-10MB, browser-specific
Decision: Sufficient for cart data, scalable to backend later

Static Book Data

Pro: Fast loading, no API calls
Con: Requires rebuild to update catalog
Decision: Acceptable for MVP, easily replaced with API

No Authentication

Assumption: Guest checkout flow
Future: Add auth with user accounts

No Payment Integration

Assumption: Focus on cart/catalog functionality
Future: Integrate Stripe/PayPal

Assumptions Made

Users primarily browse on desktop/tablet (but mobile-optimized)
Cart persists across sessions (localStorage available)
Book prices in ZAR (South African Rand)
All books available for immediate purchase
No inventory management needed
Single currency, no multi-language support (yet)

Optimization Decisions

Memoization Strategy

React.memo for components that re-render frequently
Zustand selectors for granular state subscriptions
useCallback for event handlers passed as props

Code Splitting

Lazy load modals (BookDetailsModal, ShoppingCart)
Suspense boundaries with skeleton loaders

Image Optimization

Next.js Image component with priority loading
Above-the-fold images prioritized
Below-the-fold lazy loaded
